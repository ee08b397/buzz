WALRUS GUIDE
===========================================================================

The file 'guide.txt' contains a brief guide to using Walrus.  It describes
the menus and the mouse controls, and provides supplementary information
about the LibSea graph files that Walrus uses.


===========================================================================
DIRGRAPH SCRIPTS
===========================================================================

The 'dirgraph' subdirectory contains some scripts for generating Walrus
graphs from directory trees.  They may prove useful in helping to clarify
the details of the graph format, and they are available for you to build
upon in your own work.  See the file 'walrus-directory.graph' in the
'samples' subdirectory of this distribution for a sample of the generated
graphs.

These scripts require Perl and Bash (both in /usr/local/bin), although a
Bourne shell may be substituted for the latter with some minor tweaking of
the scripts.  There are five files, but the main script is 'dirgraph'; the
others are auxillary scripts invoked by 'dirgraph'.  This script takes a
directory name as its sole parameter and writes out a graph to stdout.  For
example, to create a graph from all mounted filesystems, do the following
from within the 'dirgraph' subdirectory:

  $ ./dirgraph / >root.graph


===========================================================================
LIBSEA DOCUMENTATION
===========================================================================

The file 'graph-format.txt' describes the syntax of the LibSea graph file
format.  Walrus currently ignores any paths, visualization hints, or
interface hints stored in a file.

The file 'graph-examples.txt' contains some examples of graphs of varying
complexity.  Because Walrus relies on conventions beyond the minimum
requirements of a well-formed LibSea graph, these examples are not Walrus
graphs.  Nevertheless, they should be helpful in clarifying the file
format.
